# aimTrainer
A basic aim trainer made using Python with stats 

This is one my first projects that I'm sharing on gitHub to show my progression and imporvement in my understanding of coding.


This project provided me with an introduction to fundamental programming concepts such as classes and object-oriented programming. 

I learned how to structure code into reusable components and break down tasks using functions, increasing readability as well as understanding. 

Event handling taught me how to respond to user input and system events effectively.

I gained more understanding in variable scopes and how they impact my functions and code.

I gained experience in utilizing external libraries like Pygame for graphics and game functionalities.
